# Intro

ARCOS stands for **A**utomated **R**ecognition of **Co**llective **S**ignalling. The package implements an algorithm for identification and tracking of spatially clustered objects in time series data. It works with 1-, 2-, and 3D geometries. 

The algorithm tackles the problem of identification of protein activation in 2- and 3D cell cultures that occur collectively in neighbouring cells over time. Such collective waves of protein activation have been recently identified in various biological systems. They have been demonstrated to play an important role in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis ([Gagliardi et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.145573), [Takeuchi et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.11.089), [Aikin et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60541)), in the acinar morphogenesis ([Ender et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.20.387167)), osteoblast regeneration ([De Simone et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03085-8)), and in the coordination of collective cell migration ([Aoki et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2017.10.016), [Hino et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.05.011)).

Despite the focus on cell signalling, the algorithm can be also applied to other spatially correlated phenomena that occur over time.


Key features of the *aggregative tracking* algorithm implemented in the `ARCOS::trackCollEvents` function:

- data for tracking should be organised in the long format where each row is object's location and time,
- the function accepts objects in a long-format `data.table`,
- the `data.table` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/) is used as the main data structure throughout the ARCOS package,
- the `dbscan` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbscan/) is used for the spatial clustering.


General flow of the algorithm:

1. In the first frame, every available object becomes a *seed* of a collective event.
3. The `dbscan` algorithm aims to cluster all objects in the current frame. Objects within a *threshold distance* are clustered into collective events with a minimum *threshold size*.
4. Move to the next frame and match objects to collective events identified in previous frames. To match objects between frames, calculate the Cartesian product of two long-format tables. One holds all current objects, the other holds all objects from collective events in the previous frame(s). 
5. All unmatched objects in the current frame form *seeds* of new collective events.

The algorithm flow prepared with the [code2flow](https://app.code2flow.com/nboDrmgQxXvp) web app.

# Simple example

In this example 4 distinct objects are moving in 1 dimension over 5 time points. We aim to identify clusters of objects moving close to each other.

## Time sequence

The minimal data in the long format consists of 3 columns:

- `frame` with the frame number that corresponds to the time point,
- `objid` with the unique identifier of every object,
- `x` with the position of the object.


```{r echo = T, results="asis"}
require(data.table)

dtIn = data.table(frame = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5),
                  objid = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4),
                  x = c(1, 3, 1.2, 2.5, 3.5, 0.9, 2.6, 2.9, 3.2, 1.1, 2.8, 3.1, 1, 3))

knitr::kable(dtIn)
```

Each object has a distinct identifier represented by a different colour in the plot:

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, caption="Visualisation of object traces over time"}
ggplot(dtIn,
       aes(x=x,
           y = frame,
           color = factor(objid),
           group = objid)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Object id:") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Detection and tracking

In this step 3 objects on the right are grouped into a single collective event that spans 5 frames. A single object on the left forms a trivial single-object event. 

The most important parameter of the `trackCollEvents` function is the search radius `inEps`, which sets the distance for:

- the `dbscan` spatial clustering in a single time frame,
- possible objects that can be part of collective events identified in previous frame(s).

The minimum size of the spatial cluster is set using the `inMinPts` parameter, which is also passed to `dbscan`. The parameter `inNprev` determines the number of previous frames that are searched for collective events in order to match them to objects in the current frame.

The parameter `inCols` contains a list with column names of the input data (`frame`, `id`, `x`, `y`, `z`) and the name of the column with identifiers of collective events in the output (`collid`). The `trackCollEvents` function works in 1-, 2-, or 3D, therefore the names of respective position columns x/y/z need to be supplied depending on the geometry.

```{r, echo = T}
dtColl = trackCollEvents(dtIn,
                         inEps = 0.6,
                         inMinPts = 1L,
                         inNprev = 1L,
                         inCols = list(frame = "frame",
                                       x = "x",
                                       id = "objid",
                                       collid = "collid"),
                         inDeb = F)
```

The output contains 3 columns with the frame number, object identifier, and the calculated identifier of the collective event:

```{r echo=F, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(dtColl)
```

## Visualisation

In order to visualise collective events we merge the table computed by the `trackCollEvents` function with the original table by the frame number (column `time`) and the object identifier (column `objid`):


```{r echo = T}
dtIn = merge(dtIn, 
             dtColl, 
             by = c("frame", "objid"))
```

Each trace is assigned an identifier of the collective event, which is represented by the shape of the point in the plot:

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, caption="Visualisation of collective events over time"}
ggplot(dtIn,
       aes(x=x,
           y = frame,
           color = factor(objid),
           group = objid)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(aes(shape = as.factor(collid)), size = 2) +
  scale_shape_discrete("Collective id:") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Object id:") +
  theme_bw()
```

The algorithm with the search radius `inEps=0.6` has identified two collective events. One is a trivial event with only a single object, the latter is an event that consists of 1 to 3 objects at different points in time.

# Detection from images

Here we detect and track a concentrically growing cluster of active objects directly from a sequence of 12 binary PNG images at 64-by-64 pixel resolution. We treat each pixel in the image as a separate object, to which we assign an `objID` number. The `objID` identifier is the same for objects with the same X/Y position in subsequent frames.

Objects (pixels) have values either 0 or 1, which correspond to an inactive or active object, respectively. Objects with value 1 are *active* and our goal is to detect and track a collective activation of all such objects in all frames of the time sequence. 

## Read data from images

We use the `OpenImageR::readImage` function to read the data from PNG images.

```{r,echo=T}
# Prepare a string vector with image files to load
vFiles = list.files(path = file.path(system.file("concentricGrowth", package="ARCOS"), "png_64"), 
                    pattern = "*.png", 
                    full.names = T)

# Load images; store data in a long format in a data.table.
lIn = lapply(seq_along(vFiles), function (ii) {
  
  # Image file name
  locFin = vFiles[ii]
  
  # Read a PNG image
  locM = OpenImageR::readImage(locFin)
  
  # Convert to long format
  locDT = as.data.table(reshape2::melt(locM, 
                                       value.name = "m"))
  setnames(locDT, 
           c("Var1", "Var2"), 
           c("y", "x"))
  
  # Add "time" and "cellID" columns
  locDT[,
        `:=`(m = as.numeric(m),
             objID = .I,
             time = ii)]
})

dtIn = rbindlist(lIn)
rm(vFiles, lIn)
```


The final long-format input data with active/inactive objects. Columns:

- `x` and `y` correspond to X/Y coordinates of an object,
- `m` contains the binarised measurement $\{0,1\}$ that corresponds to inactive/active objects, respectively. For the identification of collective events we will only use *active* objects, i.e. $m > 0$,
- `objID` holds an object identifier, which should be *at least* unique within a single time frame,
- `time` indicates the time frame number.

```{r echo=F, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(head(dtIn))
```

## Time sequence

Here we plot the time sequence with a growing concentric circle. Each frame (time point) consists of a matrix of 64x64 objects, where each object can assume a value of 0 (inactive) or 1 (active). In this example objects **do not** change their positions or identities across frames. In general, both positions and object identifiers may change between frames.

```{r,echo=F, fig.width=6, fig.height = 5, caption="Concentrically growing circle"}
ggplot(dtIn,
       aes(x = x,
           y = y)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = as.factor(m))) +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(name = "Meas",
                               palette = "Classic Gray 5") +
  facet_wrap(~ time, ncol = 4) +
  coord_fixed(ratio=1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") +
  xlab("x") +
  ylab("y") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Detection and tracking 

We use the `ARCOS::trackCollEvents` function to identify collective events in frames and to link them between frames. The input data to the `trackCollEvents` function should be in the **long format**, where each row contains a position and timing of an object that may participate in a collective event. 

Since we aim to identify the collective activation, we pass a subset of our data only with *active* objects, i.e. `dtIn[m > 0]`.

```{r, echo = T}
dtColl = ARCOS::trackCollEvents(inDT = dtIn[m > 0], 
                                inEps = 4, 
                                inMinPts = 1L, 
                                inNprev = 1L, 
                                inCols = list(frame = "time",
                                              x = "x",
                                              y = "y",
                                              z = NULL,
                                              id = "objID",
                                              collid = "collID"),
                                inDeb = F)
```

The result from tracking of collective events is a long-format `data.table` with columns:

- `time` with the frame number,
- `objID` with an identifier of an object involved in a collective event,
- `collID` with an identifier of a collective event that is unique across the entire frame sequence.

```{r echo=F, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(head(dtColl))
```

## Visualisation

In order to visualise collective events we merge the table computed by the `trackCollEvents` function with the original table by the frame number (column `time`) and the object identifier (column `objID`):

```{r echo = T}
dtRes = merge(dtIn,
              dtColl,
              by = c("time", "objID"))
```


Here we display frames with collective events. The algorithm identified a single event in 10 subsequent frames:

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=6, fig.height = 5, caption="Collective events"}
ggplot(dtRes,
       aes(x = x,
           y = y)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = as.factor(collID))) +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(name = "ID collective\nevent",
                               palette = "Tableau 10") +
  facet_wrap(~ time) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(dtIn$x), max(dtIn$x))) +
  scale_y_reverse(limits = c(max(dtIn$y), min(dtIn$y))) +
  coord_fixed(ratio=1) +
  xlab("x") +
  ylab("y") +
  theme_bw()
```

The comparison of the result against the ground truth:

```{r, echo = F, results="asis", eval = T}
resTest = testthat::test_that("dmd exp05", {
  locDTtrueRes = fread(file = file.path(system.file("concentricGrowth", package="ARCOS"), "exp05_out.csv"))
  expect_equal(dtColl, locDTtrueRes)
})

if (resTest)
  cat("Test against the true result passed.") else 
    cat("Test against the true result did not pass!")
```
